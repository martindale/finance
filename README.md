personal financial records

**[Original thought in Slack](https://maki-dev.slack.com/archives/finance/p1462053118000054):**
> I'm exploring [1] the idea of publishing all personal financial details, including (or perhaps primarily?) transaction details.  This is somewhat similar to a blockchain, but without the proof of work (since we'd be trusting GitHub to keep the records for us).
> 
> Perhaps something like a `git` commit per transaction I make, appending to a `ledger.csv` file and perhaps updating a `balances.json`?  GitHub would even host our API, since the JSON is accessible in this manner.
